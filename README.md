## Lightkurve Web Interface

**A web interface for Kepler & TESS time series analysis implementing the Lightkurve package.**  

**Lightkurve** is a community-developed, open-source Python package which offers a beautiful and user-friendly way to analyze astronomical flux time series data, in particular the pixels and lightcurves obtained by **NASA's Kepler and TESS exoplanet missions**.  

The [Lightkurve package](https://github.com/KeplerGO/lightkurve) aims to lower the barrier for students, astronomers, and citizen scientists interested in analyzing Kepler and TESS space telescope data. It does this by providing **high-quality building blocks and tutorials** which enable both hand-tailored data analyses and advanced automated pipelines.
